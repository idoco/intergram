# Half-Intergram
This project is a fork of the great https://github.com/idoco/intergram live chat widget. It aims to be only a client, meaning it is a minimal HTML+JS widget for web bots, but it could also be used with any compatible server as a live chat widget.

## Usage
Simply run `npm install`, files will then compile in `/dist` just place them inside your server.
For more info look at the provided sample python server `app.py`.
