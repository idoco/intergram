# Intergram - [Demo](https://www.intergram.xyz/)

A **Free** live chat widget that you can easily add to your website. It will let you chat with your website visitors using your Telegram messenger.

##### How?
You initiate a chat with my Telegram bot and add 2 lines of script to your website to embed the widget. Visitors' messages are sent from the chat widget to my bot server, which sends them to your Telegram messenger where you can answer them. You can also self-host the bot server to get more control of this process.

##### Why use a Telegram bot to implement a chat widget?
By using a Telegram bot, I delegate all the message routing work and chat state management to Telegram. I don't have to build fancy mobile and desktop apps for several platforms because Telegram already has a great multiplatform chat client. And, I can easily handle a huge amount of load, because my app runs completely stateless (No database) and just serves as a pipe between Telegram and the chat widget users. Only offline messages are stored in memory to be delivered when a user is online.  

### Embed Intergram in your website with these 2 simple steps

1. Open [Telegram messenger](https://web.telegram.org/), search for `@Intergram` and hit `/start` to get your unique chat ID. ([direct link](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@IntergramBot))

  <p align="center"> <img src="docs/bot-start.gif"/> </p>

2. Paste this code snippet right before the closing body tag of every page where you want the chat to appear 
(Don't forget to add your actual chat ID). 

```html
<script> window.intergramId = "Your unique chat id" </script>
<script id="intergram" type="text/javascript" src="https://www.intergram.xyz/js/widget.js"></script>
```

*Note: replying to a specific message should be used to respond to that specific visitor. Feel free to send a standard message they won't be send to any dialog. You can talk with your colleague if the bot attached to a telegram group. Use `/all [any_text]` command to broadcast to all connected chat clients

**Important Notice:** I plan to keep the hosted chat service 100% free (no ads also!), but there are some hosting expenses (servers, domain, cdn, etc), so I will soon start bundeling a [Loadmill](https://www.loadmill.com) component with the Intergram script. Loadmill is a new concept and still in Beta - **If you don't feel comfortable with this, please use your own self hosted version.**

### Bot commands
- `/start` - Link between the embedded chat and this telegram chat
- `/all [any_text]` - Send message to all online users
- `/who` - Get users list who are online now
- `/online` - Set online status for the chat. Widget is shown for users
- `/offline` - Set offline status for the chat. Widget is hidden for users
- `/ban [name]` - Ban user
- `/unban [name]` - Unban user

### Customization - [Try It](https://jsfiddle.net/z9ffzr9n/6/)
Currently you can customize all visible texts and the main widget color by setting an optional `intergramCustomizations` object in the injection script tag. (All its properties are also optional and will fallback to their original values)
```html
<script> 
    window.intergramId = "Your unique chat id";
    window.intergramCustomizations = {
        closedStyle: 'chat', // button or chat
        closedChatAvatarUrl: 'https://www.intergram.xyz/media/demo_avatar.jpg',  // only used if closedStyle is set to 'chat'
        cookieExpiration: 1, // in days. Once opened, closed chat title will be shown as button (when closedStyle is set to 'chat')
        titleClosed: 'Closed chat title',
        titleOpen: 'Opened chat title',
        introMessage: 'First message when the user opens the chat for the first time',
        autoResponse: 'A message that is sent immediately after the user sends its first message',
        autoNoResponse: 'A message that is sent one minute after the user sends its first message ' +
                        'and no response was received',
        mainColor: "#E91E63", // Can be any css supported color 'red', 'rgb(255,87,34)', etc
        alwaysUseFloatingButton: false // Use the mobile floating button also on large screens
        displayMessageTime: true, // Show or hide time indicators in the chat window
        displayBanner: true, // Show or hide banner on the bottom side of the chat window
        desktopHeight: 500, // Height of the chat window on desktop
        desktopWidth: 370, // Width of the chat window on desktop
    };
</script>
<script id="intergram" type="text/javascript" src="https://www.intergram.xyz/js/widget.js"></script>
```

### Initial Footprint
  - Using [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) helped creating a pretty minimal `js` bundle.
  - The widget injection script is about 5KB gziped and executes only after the host page finished loading ('onload' event).
  - The chat iframe will only be loaded if the user interacts with the chat widget (currently about 40KB gziped).

### Deploy your own Intergram instance (Self Hosting)
1. Talk to Telegram [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather), create a new bot and get its API Token.

2. Deploy this repo to your own chat server. 
  - Clone it locally and install or if you use Heroku, fork this repository and point the new app to it.
  - Set an .env variable named `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` with the value you got from @BotFather

3. Point the bot webhook to your bot server by making a `GET` request to the following url
  `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<Server url>/hook`
  (Don't forget to replace with your token and server url)

4. Open a chat with your bot and hit `/start` to get your unique chat ID

5. Embed this code snippet in your website
  ```html
  <script> 
      window.intergramId = "Your unique chat ID"
      window.intergramServer = "Server url"
  </script>
  <script id="intergram" type="text/javascript" src="<Server url>/js/widget.js"></script>
  ```
